So far, our tools are limited and we must restrict ourselves to a simplified model.

    "\n",
    "Previously, we have successfully dealt with the loss function, which is a method of measuring how well our model fits the given data. The idea of the training process is to adjust iteratively the weights of our model in order to minimize the loss function. \n",
    "\n",
    "And this is where the optimizer comes in. In each training step, the optimizer updates the weights of the model w.r.t. the output of the loss function, thereby linking the loss function and model parameters together. The goal is to obtain a model which is accurately predicting the class for a new sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Any discussion about optimizers needs to begin with the most popular one, and it's called Gradient Descent. This algorithm is used across all types of Machine Learning (and other math problems) to optimize. It's fast, robust, and flexible. Here's how it works:\n",

    "3. Update weights with the corresponding gradient.\n",
    "4. Iteratively perform Step 1 to 3 until converges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the optimizer already hints at the required concept: We use gradients which are very useful for minimizing a function. The gradient of the loss function w.r.t to the weights $w$ of our model tells us how to change our weights $w$ in order to minimize our loss function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The weights are updated each step as follows:\n",
    "$$ w^{(n+1)} = w^{(n)} - \\alpha \\cdot \\frac {dL}{dw}, $$\n",
